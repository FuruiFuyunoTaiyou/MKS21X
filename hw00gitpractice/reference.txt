List of git cmds I have learned so far
- clone
  - For downloading a repo to a new device (one that did not previously have that repo)
- pull
  - For downloading as a way of updating the device (used subsequently after clone)
- push
  - For uploading the repo (updating) to the github website
- add
  - For marking/tracking which files to commit
- commit
  - For saving a file locally and making the changes permanent
  - When committing, use: -m "insert description here" to add a description
- config
  - For setting up the local git program
  - Use --global <key> to assign a value to that key and --list [<key>] to check the assigned values.
